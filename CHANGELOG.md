Unreleased
- Updated dependencies where reasonable
- Bumped MSRV to 1.54
- BREAKING: Updated to `zbus` 2.0. This changes error types and public path fields.
- BREAKING: `Error::Crypto` now contains a `&'static str` instead of a `String`.

[2.0.1]
- Updated crate's Rustdoc link

[2.0.0]
- dbus replaced by zbus, PURE RUST!
- update to 2018 edition
- BREAKING: `SsError` renamed to `Error`
- BREAKING: variants added to `Error`
- BREAKING: attributes are now `HashMap<&str, &str>` or `HashMap<String, String>` instead of `Vec<(&str, &str)>`. Not sure why I decided this way back when, but it could cause unexpected behavior for user: when the `Vec` was transformed to `HashMap` internally, tuples could be lost if the keys were the same.
- BREAKING: `Collection::new` and `Item::new` are now private (although I don't think it was possible to use them anyways)
